### Some cool quotes I can relate with:
- "You can either be you, or you can be who everyone else thinks you are, and I've made my choice." - I forgot where this was from, but its one of the things that encoraged me to embrace the trans feelings ive had for a while but hid down due to reasons I don't wanna discuss.
- "All warfare is based on deception." - Sun Tzu, The Art of War. (im not a techno fan, I never really watched him, but the quote is kinda nice)
